<p class='margin-bottom5'>We celebrated the birthday of our legend, Supra. He is such a person who do not even want to disclose himself. We went to the Civil Engineering Department on the 3rd floor and took lots of photos. I was so happy there. We went there for bird watching, in other sense, just parrrot watching.

In there, I even captured a photo of Ajnabi, in that he was trying to achieve a great grand skill, which was to catch a pebble once he throws in the air.

Well, here is a two liner, I said to Supra,

Are you a bird?
Becasue I came to WATCH you.

no one got it at all. Maybe, it sounded too childish; but then, We been to Cafe 92. Surprisingly there were not many people there.

<p class='margin-bottom5'>Me for the first time went to the Sunoj sir's home in there I didn't mean to go as a scavanger but I admit, it was all a mirror. It was so beautiful that I was not able to get through it. Enough about my character, now the event.
So, We were Ajnabi, Ankit, Priyanka, Malvika(an intern student joined two days ago), Manojit, Supra, Gargee, Nupur, and me. 
The first moment of entry was very tricky, Tricky for me. They rang the bell and got hidden behind the wall and pushed me in front of door. However, these people obviously are not good at tricks, you know right?
Now, that we entered, thanks to me, then, as usual people are suppose to not know me. The whole event was set at a time of 7:30PM to 01:00AM.
In this period people ate food and danced. It's not surprising that I am not talking about me in the last part of the sentence.

However, one thing was very surprising I ate rice but it wasn't mean to be rice.
What I mean is the rice was so tasty that I hate to really call it just rice. To be honest this was the best taste of rice I had eaten so far.
The event was set as a plot of meeting with our former alumni named Shayan. 

In the meantime, people played games as well.
First one, dumbsee: which as usual you are good at guess. It has to be a person who really knows how to be good at mimicking. We dared not to win as the game was suppose to favor the Team Actress. Second one, Chemistry Word Game: Which ended in a tie, in there, We were the ones who would have won,I mean it was very probable, however, the opposite team was in a hurry to go home . 
But as usual you also know, we let other people win or we end it in a tie, not that we wouldn't have won, and I mean it.

I really loved the moments there. In whole year, that was the moment when I was surrounded with so many happy faces.
Finally we said bye to professor, and alumni Shayan.
