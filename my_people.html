<h1>Suri:</h1>
	This is the nickname of KGPK which is another nickname of Surendra Longre, that is me. Since I came here, I feel like I have got a family myself.
	I feel very happy when I am here(in the lab of my prof.)  
	[sleepy and thoughtful] since I'm the youngest here everyone loves me[assumption] and takes care of me..... why I'm so sleepy . . . . . sleeps....zzzz! 

<h1>Sunoj sir: </h1>
	Very dedicated person. He even tries to be with the team, while being 
	really very very serious, that is truly an amazing, no an incredible ability.
	However, I must say he is indeed one of the best person I have ever met.
	Of course, I will not assume myself to be his friend, because I am not that serious person.
	In teaching he is the only prof. other than Balkrishna sir that I can think of,  I have never met such amazing profs. ever.
	
<h1>Supra:</h1>
	Very supportive person. 
	The most amazing thing about him is that, even on his birthday he didn't felt any different than a normal day.
	Well, I was very unhappy by that act of him. 
	I mean even if he isn't feeling any different even then, isn't this is quite like ritual to at least pretend to be feeling amazing. Afterall, we celebrated his birthday [teasing only, not to be taken by other means].
	No matter how is the determination of other teammates, I must agree Ajnabi is quite determined.
	He left no chance to know if there is any girl of Supra's liking.
	He asked a question. Then a question with a question.
	Then a manipulated question.
	Afterwards, a question on top of question and a question.
	However, Supra was just on another level he didn't disclosed even a single bit of it.

	If something is in her mind she will not listen no matter what you say, even if you call her by name. 
	For example I asked to help in cleaning while she didn't listen at all. 

	However, I must say she acts as a very good mentor as well, as she has told
	me alot about how communicative I must be with other people that they will try to solve
	if I feel any discomfort or if I am working on something and it will take alot of brain
	power to solve or if I don't have the idea of what a particular topic actually mean at all.

<h1>Ajanabi:</h1>
<!--	Very helpful person. He even helped me with a notebook otherwise I must have gotten scoled by sir.-->

<h1>Gargee:</h1>
	She is a very serious person. I don't believe she even smiles. Even on her birthday I almost thought
	she really has a fake smile.
	However, she is indeed the person who really helped me alot in the CH504 course as well. 
	I don't like to praise people myself however, I must say, she almost took the responsibility of all of the TAs just on herself. 
	I wonder how she managed to reply to all the doubts of so many students in the course, because
	everyone just used to ask to her only for doubts on Teams(a Microsoft Application).
